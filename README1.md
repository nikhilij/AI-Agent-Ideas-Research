# üß† AI Agent: Meeting Summary + Action Tracker
## üåü Vision
To create an autonomous AI agent that seamlessly integrates into the modern workflow, transforming meeting-heavy cultures into action-oriented powerhouses. This agent will eliminate the manual overhead of summarizing meetings, tracking commitments, and updating project management tools, thereby freeing up thousands of hours of valuable employee time and ensuring perfect accountability.
## üéØ Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced, remote-first work environment, meetings are both essential and overwhelming. Key decisions get lost in long discussions, action items are forgotten, and the responsibility of documenting and following up falls on busy project managers or diligent team members. This manual process is:
- **Time-Consuming:** Hours are spent re-watching recordings, deciphering notes, and manually creating tasks.
- **Error-Prone:** Important details can be missed or misinterpreted.
- **Inefficient:** It creates a significant lag between decision-making and execution.
- **Lacks Accountability:** Without a systematic process, follow-ups are inconsistent, and commitments can slip through the cracks.
## ‚ú® Solution: The Action-Tracker Agent
This project introduces an intelligent agent that automates the entire post-meeting workflow. It listens, understands, and acts.
- **Looks like:** A simple bot that emails you a meeting summary.
- **Actually does:** It's a full-fledged productivity engine that captures discussions from video conferencing platforms, uses advanced language models to extract decisions and assign follow-ups, and then automatically updates your project management systems like Jira or Asana.
**Why companies will love it:** It saves thousands of project management hours weekly, enforces a culture of accountability, and creates a perfect, searchable archive of all meeting outcomes.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow
The agent operates in a sequential, event-driven flow, from capturing the meeting audio to distributing the final action items. The diagram below illustrates this process.

*This enhanced Mermaid diagram features a left-to-right (LR) layout for better horizontal flow and readability, improved node shapes (e.g., rounded for starts, diamonds for decisions), emojis for visual appeal, multi-line labels for clarity, and themed color schemes for each phase (blue for Capture, purple for Processing, green for Action). Subgraphs are styled with custom fills and borders to create a more professional, modern UI. The overall design emphasizes proficiency with cleaner connections, grouped phases, and highlighted key components (orchestrator and report nodes). For an interactive UI with zoom, pan, and export controls‚Äîincluding direct download as PNG, SVG, or PDF‚Äîpaste this code into the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live). In the editor, click the "Actions" menu (top-right) and select "Download PNG" for a high-resolution image export. You can also apply themes like "Dark" or "Forest" for further customization.*
